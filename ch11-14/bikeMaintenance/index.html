            <p>
                    When I worked at a bike shop, by far the most common, avoidable, and potentially costly mistake I saw people make was to neglect drivetrain maintenance.
                In any vehicle, the drivetrain is the group of components that transfer power to the wheels, in this case through the front gears and the chain
                to the rear wheel. A bicycle chain is made up of hundreds of plates, attached with pins that have rollers around them. Over time,
                the parts of the chain that move and contact other surfaces begin to wear away, increasing the distance beween links and adding side-to-side flex.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The changing shape of the chain begins to wear down the gears, and can eventually lead to the chain simply slipping forward over the teeth when they're 
                sufficiently worn down. Additionally, the side-to-side flex can result in a loss of shifting performance, or even dropping the chain off the gears. 
                Replacing a worn-out chain is fairly inexpensive, though replacing worn out gears can get quite a bit more costly. Though chain wear 
                is unavoidable, their lives can be extended through cleaning and lubrication as needed (no WD-40) and the gears may never wear out if
                the chain is replaced when it dies (typically once a year or so for a regular rider).
            </p>
